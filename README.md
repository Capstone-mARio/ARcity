# ARCity
AR City is an immersive Augmented Reality iOS experience that allows users to walk around the city, play AR games, and earn fun collectable trophies. Along the way, they will need to search for coins hidden throughout the city, giving them an interactive and exciting way to explore New York!

# Gameplay and Screenshots
Upon creating an account, new users are met by Doge, who will be their guide throughout ARCity. Game locations can be found on the homepage or in our GeoView. By clicking the locations, users can plot a route to the target location via Google Maps.

Once they arrive, they can see a colorful box representing the game. We currently have 2 games. In the landing game, users try to land a ball onto one of the colored platforms. In our second game, the shooting game, users shoot fireballs at asteroids as they fall from the sky.

Once any of these games are completed, users are rewarded with coins to purchase trophies with. Coins can also be picked up at different geolocations throughout the city. Once a trophy is purchased, they can be viewed on the trophy page, or even in 3D in our augmented reality trophy room!

# Key Technologies
The key technologies that we used to build this app were React Native, Viro Media, and Firebase.

We chose React Native because it allowed us to translate our knowledge in React to easily develop and style native applications. React Native also provides a wide range of built-in features, specifically the geolocation API.

We went with Viro Media because it let us develop AR features quickly and because it seamlessly integrated with React Native. Viro also came with many useful development options such as world physics, support for 3d models, and extensive component documentation.

For our backend, we chose Firebase because it provided us with secure user authentication as well as the option to scale our app in the future to support multiplayer interaction in our augmented reality world.

In addition to these main technologies, we also incorporated Google Maps and we performed testing using Jest.


# There are tons of places to explore, games to play, and trophies to earn!
